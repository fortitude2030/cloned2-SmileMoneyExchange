implement the following but first ask me before implementing. avoid complex changes to the codebase and stick to the current designs and tools like firebase auth.

Based on my analysis, I'll implement Phase 1: Data Collection Completeness. Here's what I plan to change:

Proposed Changes for Phase 1
1. Enhanced Organization Creation Form
Current: Basic fields (name, registration, address, contact info, business type)
New: Add regulatory required fields:

- PACRA Certificate Number
- ZRA TPIN Number
- OPTIONAL, PACRA OR BUSINESS LICENSE, NOT AND - Business License Number & Expiry Date
- WE WILL NOT KEEP ANY BANK DETAILS, TO AVOID FRAUD & HACKING LIABILITY. BANK DETAILS WILL BE MANAGED BY THE ORGANISATION AND TRANSMITTED EVERY TIME A SETTLEMENT REQUEST IS MADE. OUR AML SYSTEM SHOULD MONITOR AND FLAG ANY CHANGE IN BANK DETAILS FROM THE THE PREVIOUS SETTLEMENT REQUESTS - Banking Details (Primary Bank, Account Number)
- OPTIONAL - Director/Owner Information (Name, NRC, Phone)
- OPTIONAL - Share Capital Amount
- OPTIONAL - Physical Address Verification

2. Document-Data Cross-Validation System
Implementation:

- Validate PACRA certificate number against uploaded PACRA document
- Cross-check ZRA TPIN number with uploaded certificate
- Verify director information matches uploaded NRC documents
- Implement document OCR/text extraction for automated validation

3. Complete Organization Profile Workflow
New Multi-Step Process:

- Step 1: Basic Organization Information (enhanced form)
- Step 2: REQUIRE PACRA OR BUSINESS LICENSE, NOT AND - Regulatory Documentation (PACRA, ZRA, Business License)
- Step 3: Director/Owner KYC Documents
- Step 4: Banking and Financial Information
- Step 5: Final Review and Submission

4. Data Completeness Enforcement
Business Logic Changes:

- Prevent organization activation until all required fields completed
- Block user assignment to incomplete organizations
- Enforce document upload before status changes
- Add validation rules for Zambian regulatory requirements

5. Database Schema Updates
New Fields in Organizations Table:

- businessLicenseNumber, businessLicenseExpiry
- primaryBankName, primaryAccountNumber
- directorName, directorNrc, directorPhone
- shareCapitalAmount, physicalAddressVerified
- profileCompletionPercentage, requiredFieldsComplete

6. Enhanced KYC Document Management
Improvements:

- Link documents to specific organization data fields
- Implement document expiry tracking
- Add document quality validation
- Create document replacement workflow

Based on my analysis, I'll implement Phase 1: Data Collection Completeness. Here's what I plan to change:

Proposed Changes for Phase 1
1. Enhanced Organization Creation Form
Current: Basic fields (name, registration, address, contact info, business type)
New: Add regulatory required fields:

PACRA Certificate Number
ZRA TPIN Number
Business License Number & Expiry Date
Banking Details (Primary Bank, Account Number)
Director/Owner Information (Name, NRC, Phone)
Share Capital Amount
Physical Address Verification
2. Document-Data Cross-Validation System
Implementation:

Validate PACRA certificate number against uploaded PACRA document
Cross-check ZRA TPIN number with uploaded certificate
Verify director information matches uploaded NRC documents
Implement document OCR/text extraction for automated validation
3. Complete Organization Profile Workflow
New Multi-Step Process:

Step 1: Basic Organization Information (enhanced form)
Step 2: Regulatory Documentation (PACRA, ZRA, Business License)
Step 3: Director/Owner KYC Documents
Step 4: Banking and Financial Information
Step 5: Final Review and Submission
4. Data Completeness Enforcement
Business Logic Changes:

Prevent organization activation until all required fields completed
Block user assignment to incomplete organizations
Enforce document upload before status changes
Add validation rules for Zambian regulatory requirements
5. Database Schema Updates
New Fields in Organizations Table:

businessLicenseNumber, businessLicenseExpiry
primaryBankName, primaryAccountNumber
directorName, directorNrc, directorPhone
shareCapitalAmount, physicalAddressVerified
profileCompletionPercentage, requiredFieldsComplete
6. Enhanced KYC Document Management
Improvements:

Link documents to specific organization data fields
Implement document expiry tracking
Add document quality validation
Create document replacement workflow
Do you want me to proceed with implementing these Phase 1 changes? This will involve:

Database schema updates
Enhanced organization creation forms
Document validation logic
Business rule enforcement
Updated API endpoints
Please confirm if you'd like me to start implementation or if you'd like me to modify any aspect of this plan.
